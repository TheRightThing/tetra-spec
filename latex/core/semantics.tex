\chapter{Core}

\section{Values}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Redefine values.
  \item Have to be homomorphic to fundamentals.Values.
\end{itemize}

\section{Statements}

\section{Expressions}

\section{Datatypes}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All type instances have to specified as either const or mut.
  \item How do types look?
  \item Differentiate structs with same names and members.
  \item Values hold a list/mapping of types which implement/inherit this base.
  \item Have types with an extra ID. Have a tuple of (Values, TypeID), where Values $\equiv$ fundamentals.Values:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Query for: What is the next lower level deriving type.
      \item Query for: What is the lowest level deriving type.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Typecasts:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Conversion casts, e.g.: Int -> Float.
      \item Model as function, which is called implicitly. Will be predefined for primitive types.
      \item Lens casts, e.g.: InheritingClass -> BaseClass -> InheritingClass.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Inheritance.
  \item Classes/Structs:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item All structs explicitly inherit/implement some base-class.
    \item Virtual member-functions.
    \item Override member-functions of explicitly stated base-class.
    \item Abstract member-functions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Functions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item All functions have a unique type associated, not the return type.
  \item Support new expression:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Statements and expressions have to redefined on this level.
      \item Need to include casts, type-queries, etc.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Misc}
\begin{itemize}
  \item VTables.
  \item Everything is explicit, there are no implicit conversions.
  \item New statements for conversion operator.
  \item Primitives are explicitly defined.
\end{itemize}
