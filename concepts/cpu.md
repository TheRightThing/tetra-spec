# CPU
## HDL
- VHDL syntax is bloated
- Verilog seems quite nice:
  * Maybe best tooling around
- SystemVerilog like Verilog + some extra
- Chisel, kinda like Java. Maybe too high-level.
- BlueSpec quite cool, but licensing issues.

## Concurrency
* Translate problems -> Frequencies -> Superposition for "solving"
* Contract logic around atomic variable:
  * Release: "ultra optimized"
  * Dev: "all weapons needed for analysis"
